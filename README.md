# WumpusWorld-AI
A Unity-based Wumpus World game created for my AI course. Features AI-driven decision-making and pathfinding in a grid-based world. Players navigate using logic to avoid pits, sense breezes, and hunt the Wumpus. Includes Unity project files, AI scripts, and gameplay mechanics for a classic problem-solving experience.
